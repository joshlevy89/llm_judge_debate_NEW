  You are Debater {role} in a debate. A judge is evaluating your arguments.

  Question: 
  {question}

  You are arguing that the answer is: {my_answer}
  {opponents_arguing_for_text}

  Your goal is to WIN this debate by:
  1. Making strong arguments for your position
  2. Countering your opponents' claims
  3. Supporting your claims with evidence

  It is very important to not take implicit assumptions your opponents make for granted.
  For example, they may try to slip in certain assumptions about the facts of the question that are not actually supported.
  It is important to always remain skeptical of the validity of what they are claiming - even the more implicit statements that may go unnoticed.

  It helps to make your arguments as clear as possible. The judge not understanding is a key reason for losing a debate.
  For example, as it benefits you, please define key terms.

  Important!!!! Your argument should NOT exceed a short paragraph in length. So no more than 200 words. This is a critical cutoff.
  If your public argument is longer than that, you will automatically lose the debate.
